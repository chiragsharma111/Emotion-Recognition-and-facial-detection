# Emotion-Recognition-using-facial-detection

We have used HaarCascade to detect faces in images from our dataset. It is a machine learning based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the image classifier.
Positive images - The images which we want to classifier to identify.
Negative images - The images which do not contain the object we want to detect, like face in this case. 


What is Haar Cascade?

Haar cascade is a object detection algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. This algorithm uses edge and line detection features to detect faces.
